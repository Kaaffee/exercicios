    <p>People say that its good that you use 'Hello, world!' as your first line of code, some even may 
        say that it helps you to get a better codding experience or codding learning habilitie. 
        Is it true? IDK. 
        Does it
        really matter? Maybe. 
        Will I use it? Absolutely!
